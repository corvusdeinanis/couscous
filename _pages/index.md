# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

Hi! I believe that while healing can be done alone, peer support is super helpful and in some cases, necessary. I genuinely believe the community aspect of healing is oft overlooked. 
  I believe in <span style="font-weight: bold">[[survivor led]]</span> and survivor-centric healing over ones run by medical professionals. [[survivor led|Why?]]. I also believe resources should be free, that healthcare should be accessible to everyone. This is a <span style="font-weight: bold"> community-first <span> space; by the community for the community. We share resources, stories, experiences. Because your voice matters. Because we can heal as a community.
