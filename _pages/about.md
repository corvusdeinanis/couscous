Hi! Welcome to Healing Garden. Simply put, it is a digital garden on collective healing, mental health, intersectional healing, and reflections. By the community, for the community. It hosts a community-curated list of resources, kind and keen listeners, and hopes to help you on your journey. 
<br> <br>
The idea behind this site was to build something that summed up everything I have learnt. Everything I've learnt might not be much, it might be things people already discovered themselves on their journey. But if even one person can leave this site with a new idea, fresh perspective, or a useful healing technique, the site will have served its purpose.
<br><br>
But that's not all! I realized that the strength lies in the community. That peer support is as valuable as it is scarce. That if we share everything we learn, even just tiny tidbits, we can accelerate healing. Also, this is the community's tiny effort towards making mental health resources a teeny tiny bit more accessible. ==Because knowledge is meant to be shared, not hoarded. Knowledge is meant to be distributed freely, not locked behind paywalls.==
