# Destination Mindset and Mindfullness

>[!INFO] Who will this help?
>Everyone! But mostly people who aren't in distress currently

You know when you've worked your ass off and you achieve something? Before you can even appreciate yourself for it, you're onto the next task, the next goal, the next destination. 

We've all heard "It's the journey, not the destination". It's one of those aphorisms I scoff at. _But it is true._
Destination mindset can be because of the kind of world we live in, hyper-competitive, #hustle and sigma grindset world. It can also be the result of a childhood where you had to constantly prove your worth, a childhood where perfectionism was not just a mere coping mechanism, but a survival mechanism. High expectations, parents you can never please, all that jazz. You didn't and don't deserve that though. You deserve to take a break. Taking a break does not make you lazy [[laziness|You Are Not Lazy]]. 

I digress, but let's come back to the topic on hand. Destination Mindset. Talking and writing about this makes me feel like one of those lifestyle bloggers, ones who write about zen or whatever word is fancy. "Mindfulness" sounds like one of those terms too, and it quite honestly is. It's the hottest thing right now. Want to sell something? Slap in "mindful" in there for extra points. But no, when I talk to mindfulness, I'm usually referring to the Marsha Linehan's version, which is heavily borrowed from Buddhism among other things. In short, it is a core component of DBT and it means to bring your mind back to the present moment. And not judge your thoughts. 

Sounds simple, right? Like, pfft, EVERYONE knows that! Everyone does, they do understand the concept but to foster the habit, to cultivate mindfulness? That's hard. I have ADHD, I dissociate A LOT, and a whole lot of other fun stuff. Meditation makes me feel worse for some reason. It wasn't easy for me to get started on this journey of mindfulness, and I've barely even started the journey. But I do promise that mindfulness helps. One of the reasons it took me so long was the internal resistance. I thought the concept was stupid, that it's just one of those things that people say. "Oh, have you tried yoga?" or "Oh, you should get out more I think". 

Destination Mindset is the constant focus on getting somewhere and forgetting to appreciate where we are. It's completely natural. The system "awards" constant effort, no breaks, etc. It reinforces it every single time. But no, the journey is as important as the destination. Probably more. Take a moment to celebrate yourself. (Ugh I feel like one of those fake, shallow lifestyle bloggers again, gross.)


This ties in with another important part of DBT, gratitude. Gratitude is hard when you're in a shitty place. It's almost impossible. But when you are in a relatively okay place, you should definitely start practicing gratitude. You don't even have to maintain a fancy gratitude journal. Just try to enjoy the coffee you're sipping. When was the last time you took the time out and enjoyed a meal? Half the times, I don't know what I'm eating. It's like things happen, but they don't register in my head. 

Fuck what it ought to be, what it can be, what it should have been; fuck the destination. Wherever you go, there you are. And you have the right to stop and sniff the flowers. Will you enjoy it? Maybe. Maybe not. But don't deprive yourself of the opportunity and most importantly, DON'T BE HARSH ON YOURSELF IF YOU CAN'T ENJOY SIMPLE THINGS BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'RE IN. It's natural. Asking someone to be thankful for their coffee when the world is on fire sounds stupid, and it is stupid. But be kind to yourself, and try to be more present, more in the moment.
