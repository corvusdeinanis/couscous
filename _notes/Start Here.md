Confused by the lack of hierarchy or the apparent lack of organization? Well, that's by design! Digital gardens do not have a set, rigid hierarchy. It's supposed to be organic. 

Just dive in! Find a topic, click on a related link, and keep going. That's how you'll discover related topics and you might stumble upon something interesting! 

Not everything will resonate with you, that's not the point. Use what you like, use what applies, discard the rest. 

A good starting point might be #tool but jump straight in. Can't understand a note? That's okay, just skip to the next :D
