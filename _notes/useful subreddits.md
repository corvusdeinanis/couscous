Non-exhaustive list of Mental Health related subreddits. Please feel free to 
make suggestions, if any. Still under construction, apologies for how it looks. 


⚠ - As always with anything on the Internet, take everything with a grain of salt and be careful.
Sometimes, communities can become toxic, enable, and perpetuate unhealthy behaviour. Fringe communities and 
super large ones alike. They can become echo-chambers. Use care and discretion.

###  Community and Peer-Support, not necessarily mental health specific

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/">/r/Needafriend/</a> -&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute">r/MomForAMinute</a> -&gt; &quot;We are Mother Geese to our loving Ducklings When you need understanding, congratulations, praise, or advice from a mother figure, 
but don&#39;t have one IRL able or willing to provide that for you -- we are here for you. We support you and love you unconditionally!&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DadForAMinute">r/DadForAMinute</a> -&gt; &quot;When you need understanding, congratulations, praise, or advice from a father figure, 
but don&#39;t have one IRL able or willing to provide that for you -- we are here for you. We support you and love you unconditionally!&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamiliesYouChoose">r/FamiliesYouChoose</a> -&gt; &quot;If you want to create or join an internet family, this is the place for you. 
Family doesn&#39;t just have to be blood relatives. It can be based on similar interests or similar histories, whatever.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMixedNuts/">/r/TheMixedNuts/</a> -&gt; A relaxed, safe space to embrace our craziness. It can sometimes be difficult to 
discuss mental illness with those who don&#39;t live it and more often than not, people tiptoe around us. This is an open space 
for us to laugh, cry, question, vent, rant about the things that make us different.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/">/r/Assistance/</a> -&gt; &quot;Redditors helping redditors ranging from financial assistance and wishlist fulfillment to advice, 
support, contest votes, and surveys. This is a subreddit of regular people who can help with short term support.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/">/r/internetparents/</a> - Ask the internet about things your parents never taught you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/">/r/KindVoice/</a> -&gt; &quot;Feeling low, alone, tired of it all, or simply bored? Whatever the cause, you can come and find someone 
to talk to. You can also offer your time to talk to someone else. We help people find support by matching people looking for help and people
who are here to help. So, whether you are looking for support or willing to support others, pop-in and be a part of a community that cares.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/">/r/whatsbotheringyou/</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/">/r/MMFB/</a> -&gt; &quot;This is the place to share your stories and receive words of encouragement. Don&#39;t go through it alone!&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/">/r/offmychest/</a> -&gt; &quot;A mutually supportive community where deeply emotional things you can&#39;t tell people you know can be told. Whether it&#39;s long-standing baggage, happy thoughts, or recent trauma, posting it here may provide some relief. 
We&#39;ll listen, and if you want, we&#39;ll talk. We aim to keep this a safe space.&quot;</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/">/r/TrueOffMyChest/</a> -&gt; &quot;A place to get personal things off your chest. Not for opinions, not for relationship advice, 
and not for preaching.&quot;</p>
