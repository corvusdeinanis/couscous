## You Are Not Lazy 

If you have chronic illness, disability, or just feel super tired and you've been made to feel guilty, this is for you. YOU ARE NOT LAZY. 

Different tasks need different amount of energy, right? And different people need different amounts of energy for the same task. Sounds like such a fundamentally simple concept but people don't seem to recognize this. 

And for a lot of us, the amount of mental work we constantly do is enough to tire us out. This can look like laziness to others, but it is not. 

### What about stuff like "Secondary Gain"?
To those who aren't familiar with the term, it basically means that people who are in a bad place, disabled, injured, or whatever, they might have less incentive to get better because of the sympathy, attention, and other ✨amazing benefits✨they get. This might be true, but it is not always the case. In my experience, it's often not the case at all! Just go online and look at the number of people who are invalidating themselves (not their fault) and thinking they're faking their illness. Impostor syndrome in mental illness and sufferring too. "Maybe I'm just being extra?" "Maybe I did all of this for attention?" 

And even if it is true, what use is it if it causes more harm than good? People who are already traumatized go harder on themselves because of ableist bullshit like this. 

Are you saying that I enjoy the "attention" I get by not doing my work? You're right. As much as I enjoy having anxiety attacks, crying, and panicking over the same unfinished work. It's easier to do the work than go through this hell. It is easier to go through shit and get it done than faking an illness, having breakdowns, and being hyper-aware of the consequences of my actions. Why don't I just do it then? Definitely not because there's a road block in my head. It's because I'm lazy AND I enjoy this, duh!
