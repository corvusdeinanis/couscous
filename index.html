# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
Hi! I believe that while healing can be done alone, peer support is super helpful and in some cases, necessary. I genuinely believe the community aspect of healing is oft overlooked.  <br> <br>
  I believe in <span style="font-weight: bold">[[survivor led]]</span> and survivor-centric healing over ones run by medical professionals. [[survivor led|Why?]].</span> <br> <br>
 I also believe resources should be free, that healthcare should be accessible to everyone. This is a <span style="font-weight: bold"> community-first <span> space; by the community for the community. We share resources, stories, experiences. Because your voice matters. Because we can heal as a community. Share everything you've found helpful in your journey and take a look at everything that has helped others. And remember, your journey is yours, it's <span style="font-weight: bold">personal<span>; take what works for you and discard the rest. You are valid. Your emotions are. ðŸŒ»â™¥
